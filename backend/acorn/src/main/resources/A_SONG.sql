How you tried to hide in darkness
Slipped from orbit
Now you’re dangerously close

Come out, come out
From all your hiding out
We’ll dig in our heels
Salute the battlefields
Where our broken hearts were born, oh

And the storm clouds are thirsty
I can see them bursting, watch them gathering light
And the walls in the bedroom now are pounding out
Were we broken open baby, maybe just a crack
Swore I heard you whisper that you preferred us like that, oh

My broken open child
Were we thirsty, thorned with wild eyes
Still, we are slaves to the sirens of the salty sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh', 1);

When we were younger and free
I''ve forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

I must''ve called a thousand times
To tell you I''m sorry for everything that I''ve done
But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I''ve tried
To tell you I''m sorry for breaking your heart
But it don''t matter, it clearly doesn''t tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It''s so typical of me to talk about myself, I''m sorry
I hope that you''re well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

It''s no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

About that night,
The bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging?

Before those hands pulled me
